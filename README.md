## This project has now been Archived

The alfresco-core, alfresco-data-model, alfresco-repository and alfresco-remote-api projects have been archived with their code incorporated into [alfresco-community-repo]( https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo) to simply ongoing development. The same artifacts are still produced by the new project. It also has a branch used as the basis of each of ACS 6 Enterprise release. For more information, set the new projectâ€™s README.md file.

### Building and testing
The project can be built by running Maven command:

The tests are combined in test classes split by test type or Spring application context used in the test, see classes in _src/test/java/org/alfresco_. All of these classes as well as individual tests can be run by specifying the test class name and a set of DB connection properties, for example:
~~~
mvn clean test -Dtest=SomeTest -Ddb.driver=org.postgresql.Driver -Ddb.name=alfresco -Ddb.url=jdbc:postgresql:alfresco -Ddb.username=alfresco -Ddb.password=alfresco
~~~
